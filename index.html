        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a test page meant for testing out github, git commands, and all that git stuff.
        <br>It's also a page where I mess around with HTML a bit.

            <p>It's gonna be funny.
            <br>What I have decided to do is take a particular phrase, saying, or quote.
            <br>I will then take that and put it into google translate as English.
            <br>I will then translate that into Japanese, and then take that text and put it back into English.
            <br>I will repeat the process until we find some sort of equilibrium.
            <br>We'll see what some of the results are.
            <br>This is gonna be fun.
