            <p>What I have decided to do is take a particular phrase, saying, or quote.
            <br>I will then take that and put it into google translate as <ins>English</ins>.
            <br>I will then translate that into <i>Japanese</i>, and then take that text and put it back into English.
            <br>I will repeat the process until we find some sort of <sup>equilibrium.</sup>
            <br>We'll see what some of the results are.

                To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.<br>
                The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.<br>
                There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation-<br>
                his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.<br>
                The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.<br>
                As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots-<br>
                of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"<br>
                which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.<br>
                I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.<br>
                What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚<br>
