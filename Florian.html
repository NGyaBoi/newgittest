            <p>It is the 11th of May as of writing this...
            <br>and the news came in a few days ago that Florian Schneider of Kraftwerk fame has past away.
            <br>This news really hit close to home for me.
            <br>I found Kraftwerk's music in my first year of high school.
            <br>Their music was a real shockaroo for me at the time.
            <br>I was just getting started with developing my own musical tastes.
            <br>Prior to this, I really only listened to surface level indie music and some Top 40 stuff.
            <br>My initial foray into weird electronic music was Aphex Twin, but that's a story for another time.
            <br>With my discovery of Kraftwerk, I started to appreciate the progression of technology and how that shaped music.
            <br>I used to listen to the song Autobahn on the bus ride to school.
            <br>That song perfectly fit both the timeslot of the bus ride.
            <br>It also fits very well the mood of a drive in the morning, with its sunny synth melodies and repetition.
            <br>
            <br>So I just wanna give a quick shoutout to Kraftwerk for all the inspiring music they have put out.
            <br>R.I.P. Florian.
